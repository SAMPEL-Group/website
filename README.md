**NOTE:** <br/>
- If you are currently in charge of the website, please see section VI for instructions. 
- As for other lab members, please read through section I to V for instructions on how to send different website updates to webmasters. Thank you!

## Types of Updates

The types of updates that should be included on the website are publication news, group news, and research updates. The format for each update will be described in detail from section II to VI. 

1) **Publication updates** concern new publications by any member of the group. This update would appear at two places on the website, one in the publication page and another in the news page. 
2) **Group updates** concern group outings, group pictures, additional group members, new members' bios, and REUs. Group outings and pictures will appear in the gallery page of the website, while any other news will appear in the news page. As for the bios, they will appear in the people page of our website. 
3) **Research updates** concern new information or objectives with the current projects or introduction of new projects to the group. This update will appear on the research page.

### I. Publication Updates

*The theory and simulation of systems that have realistic complexity and size and evolve across massive time scales are a critical challenge predicated upon the accurate description of many-body interactions. It builds upon the science of the small to create a new “Middle Science” whose research vision integrates modern math and data science with chemical theories as proposed in this In Focus article.*
